Quick, clean search interface for plant toxicity to pets. Information jankily scraped from [ASPCA website](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants).

Interface on gh-pages branch, scraper on master branch.

Todo
-----
+ deduplicate scraped data
+ pull wikipedia categories on plants to get more keywords? (crassula/echeveria > succulents, for example)
+ render photos, probably in a fixed sidebar on mouseover so they don't make the table rows massive
